This code was written as the artifact for my EPQ - Creating a chess bot without neural networks

Due to requirements from school the code was required to be written for use on Replit so some code such as os.system('clear') works there but not 
on other IDEs such as VSCode. This project was done in stages on Replit but as I'm centralising all my projects I have taken the time to bring this
across too with some helpful commit messages.

The purpose of this code was to implement some algorithms I discuss in my epq (Alpha - Beta pruning, Minimax, Quiescence searches etc.), whilst not 
spending too much time reinventing the wheel.
